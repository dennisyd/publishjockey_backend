    "answer": "Word is an incredible writing tool, but it's not a publishing tool. Word-to-PDF exports suffer from:\n\n1. Broken TOCs & Field Codes: The infamous \"Error! Bookmark not defined.\" ruins professional credibility\n2. No Publishing Logic: Word doesn't understand front matter, roman numerals, or design rhythm\n3. Rigid Layout Engine: Margins, text flow, and typography are mechanical, not artistic\n4. Lack of Metadata: Word exports don't optimize for searchability, accessibility, or navigation\n5. Time Lost in Post-Processing: Hours spent fixing issues that still look \"office-made,\" not \"publisher-made\"\n\nPublishJockey was built specifically for authors, educators, and professionals who want publication-quality results automatically.",
